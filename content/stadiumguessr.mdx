# StadiumGuessr

StadiumGuessr is a game to test your football stadium knowledge where you will get placed at a random football stadium around the UK and you will have to answer 3 questions about that stadium.

In order to play, users can login using their Discord account (implemented using NextAuth).

The map element of the game was implemented using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) which is an open source JavaScript map library.

Keep an eye on the leaderboard, where the top 10 scores are displayed alongside the respective dates they were achieved. Your last game score will be highlighted in blue for easy reference.
