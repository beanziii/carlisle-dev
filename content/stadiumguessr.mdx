# StadiumGuessr

StadiumGuessr is a game to test your football stadium knowledge. You will get placed at a random stadium around Europe and you will have to guess various facts about it.

You can log into StadiumGuessr using your Discord, and view the scores leaderboard to see where you match up against other users!

I was inspired by GeoGuessr, and wanted to create something similar but with more of a quiz vibe to it - hence the questions at each stadium location.

## Here is what I used to create it:

- Next.js
- NextAuth
- TypeScript
- Planetscale
- Prisma
