# StadiumGuessr

StadiumGuessr is a fun game to test your football stadium knowledge. You will get placed at a random stadium around Europe and you will have to guess various facts about it.

I was inspired by GeoGuessr, and wanted to create something similar but with more of a quiz vibe to it - hence the questions at each stadium location.

You can log into StadiumGuessr using your Discord, and view the scores leaderboard to see where you match up against other users!

## Here is what I used to create it:

- Next.js
- NextAuth
- TypeScript
- Planetscale
- Prisma
