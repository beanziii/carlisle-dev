# StadiumGuessr

StadiumGuessr is a game to test your football stadium knowledge where you will get placed at a random football stadium around the UK and you will have to answer 3 questions about that stadium.

In order to play, users can login using their Discord account (implemented using NextAuth).

The map element of the game was implemented using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) which is an open source JavaScript map library.

There is a leaderboard that displays the top 10 scores and when they were played, and also you can see your last game score highlighted in blue.
