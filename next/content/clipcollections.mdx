# ClipCollections

## The issue

On Twitch, streamers often have chat commands that will respond with links to Twitch clips to provide info, for example - a FPS streamer might have commands like

- !valorantsettings
- !csgosettings
- !warzonesettings
- !warzoneloadouts

This leads to Twitch chats full of multiple commands which all do a similar thing, this then blocks up the chat full of command spam and replies.

## A simple solution

The best way to solve this is to just centralize all the clips into one place. This could be a command like !clips or !settings.

ClipCollections is a simple way to solve this, streamers just need to log into the site with Twitch, create a 'collection' and add some Twitch clip links.

## The app

I wanted to use a Tailwind components library and ended up landing with [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A tailwind UI library built ontop of Radix UI, this allows you to just copy and paste the components you need, rather than installing the whole library as a dependancy.

Creating a collection is easy, just give it a name and add the clips. This form was creating using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for client side form validation (form data also gets validated on the backend).

<Image
  src="/projects/cc_form.webp"
  alt="Upload form"
  width={1920}
  height={1032}
/>

Once you have created a collection, you can then either share your profile -

<Image
  src="/projects/cc_profile.webp"
  alt="Profile with a collection"
  width={1920}
  height={1032}
/>

Or you can share an individual collection -

<Image
  src="/projects/cc_collection.webp"
  alt="A collection of twitch clips"
  width={1920}
  height={1032}
/>

### Note on how this was made

This app itself it pretty simple but here is how I made it:

- UI components: [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Form validation: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- End-to-end typesafe API: [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- Database and ORM: [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
