# StadiumGuessr

StadiumGuessr is a game to test your football stadium knowledge where you will get placed at a random football stadium around the UK and you will have to answer guess the name of the stadium you are at.

[Try it out](https://www.stadiumguessr.app/) or you can see the [code here](https://github.com/brandon-carlisle/StadiumGuessr).

Users can either play in guest mode, or log in with either Google or Discord and be able to view a full match after each game.

The map element of the game was implemented using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) which is an open source JavaScript map library.
