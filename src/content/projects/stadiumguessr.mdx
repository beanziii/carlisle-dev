# StadiumGuessr

![StadiumGuessr play screen](../../assets/images/stadiumguessr/game.webp)

StadiumGuessr is a game to test your football stadium knowledge where you will get placed at a random football stadium around the UK and you will have to answer guess the name of the stadium you are at.

Users can either play in guest mode, or log in with either Google or Discord and be able to view a full match after each game.

The map element of the game was implemented using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) which is an open source JavaScript map library.

When you finish a game, if you are logged in - you can view a match summary that shows your game stats along with the answers you got correct or skipped.
